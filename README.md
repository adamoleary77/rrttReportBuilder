**Rapid Return to Teacher:**  
**Report Builder**


The purpose of this program is to take results from a testing management system and produce a score report to be delivered to teachers.
Eventually, the repository will also host an Excel template for the reports.  
However, the template will be stored in unzipped form so that git can track it.
